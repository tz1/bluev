You will need a modular phone cable, some extra wire, an Arduino Mega,
and the Arduino development environment you can get from
http://arduino.cc and some basic tools.

See http://harleyhacking.blogspot.com for a more detailed DIY build article.

A modular jack inserted into the accessory port on a V1 power
connection will have the following connections:

Since you will probably be cutting a pre-made cord, I would suggest
you align the end with the colors (you can usually see through the
plug) as green for ground and red for power, which would make data
yellow and audio black.

If you want a full passthrough, you can also get a dual line jack from
Lowes or similar store.  It has to be for two full (4 wire) circuits,
so have eight screw terminals inside.  Take the wires off one side and
connect them in the opposite order on the other side, i.e. one will be
black, red, green, yellow, attach yellow, green, red, and black from
the far side respectively, and run wires out to the Mega, i.e.

a+-d
BRGY
YGRB

Here I would check with a meter to figure out which side is to the
accessory power and which is to next accessory (I tend to think, which
one goes toward the V1, which toward the Concealed Display - which
also has one jack).  Data is going to be next to ground here too.

You will need to connect ground - there is a power header near the
power plug - you can buy a plug or go to the ground on the power
header.  You can connect battery to VIN or PWR_IN or the plug - the
power LED should turn on if you have this right.

Note: If the Arduino is NOT powered, it will pull down the data line
and disable the ESP function.

The DATA line goes both to pin 49 on the edge opposite the power plug
and to pin 18/TX1 near the adjacent corner.

RX2 and TX2 are now the transparent ports if you want to connect a
bluetooth module or something else.  Note that it will collide with
data from the main port so you should not do anything with the USB
serial port if you are using serial port 2.

The PC Command port now just waits for a return, but eventually it
will be a simple interface where you can use a terminal program to get
information and reconfigure your V1.

You will need the IDE from arduino.cc to compile and flash the
program.  It is available for the PC, Mac, and Linux.

Copy the bluev_sketch folder to the sketchbook folder for the Arduino.

You can open it using the IDE directly or double-click on the
bluev_sketch.ino file in the folder.

The program can then be compiled and uploaded by pressing the "play"
button.  Remember to set the COM port and the board type (it should
work with any Mega compatible, but older boards use a 1280, newer ones
use a 2560, so check which one you have.

You can use the serial monitor and use the top box to send the command
characters, but a terminal program might be easier.

Open a terminal program on the same COM port as the Arduino IDE used,
set to 57600 baud, and hit return.  It will show a menu with multiple
commands.  Infoscan looks for V1, CD, RA, and Savvy and returns all
the information available.  Alerts enables and shows alerts.
DefaultSweep will reset sweeps.  SetSweep will allow you to write a
user set of sweeps.  See the V1 docs for how to make it valid.

Note: If the bus is in legacy mode, you will see a long line with
letters representing the LEDs which are lit on the display which is
the legacy data stream.  This stream is documented at
valentineone.com.  It has been added to show the V1 is in legacy mode
and cannot accept ESP.

There is a "v1 busy message" which is
currently disabled but would show up if this is happening.
